 * What a subagent did, in one vocabulary for both OpenCodes.
 *
 * OpenCode 1 says it as `message.part.updated` / `message.part.delta` / `session.status`; OpenCode 2
 * as `session.tool.called` / `session.reasoning.delta` / `session.execution.started`. The two
 * adapters in `tui/data/` translate each into these changes, and everything after them — the model,
 * the rows — is written once. Shapes measured from real runs (test/fixtures, docs/opencode/agents.md).
 *
 * `id` is always the session the change is about; a subagent *is* a session with a parent.
